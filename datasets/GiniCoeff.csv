Definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gini Coefficient:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A summary measure of income inequality. It is equal to zero in the case of total income equality and equal to one in the case of total inequality. The more unequal the income distribution, the larger the value of the Gini coefficient. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Household Income from Work:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Refers to the sum of income received by employed members of the household from employment and business. However, it does not include the income of domestic workers. Monthly household income from work includes one-twelfth of the annual bonus. Data on household income from work refer to household income from work before accounting for Government transfers and taxes, unless stated otherwise. As the income data pertain to income from work, the coverage of households is based on resident employed households. Data on household income are based on the sample of households surveyed in the June Comprehensive Labour Force Surveys conducted by the Ministry of Manpower every year, except for 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2020 which are based on the Censuses of Population and the mid-decade General Household Survey. The income estimates are based on income as reported by survey respondents and augmented with administrative data. Survey estimates are subject to sampling variability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Household Income from Work Per Household Member:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Refers to the household income from work divided by the total number of members in the household. For example, if there is one person in a household of four who is employed, his income is divided by four to derive the income per household   member. This takes into account the different sizes of households in each group and enables analysis of changes in household income, adjusted for changes in household size over time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
